## TreeBot
This bot uses a modified TreeBot so we can see where we are in the tree.

We use [draw.io](http://draw.io/) to visualize the tree. The tree can be found under the branch [tree](https://github.com/GerardSmit/gsmelter/tree/tree). To view the tree directly without making a fork, use the [raw url](https://www.draw.io/#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGerardSmit%2Fgsmelter%2Ftree%2FTree.xml).
